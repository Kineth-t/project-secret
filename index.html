        <div class="card">I can still vividly remember the first time we saw each other at the dance session. This girl that is just disturbing Kingsley and hyping him up. Not to mention the first ever photo that we took, so awkward...</div>
        <div class="card">I also remember the first time we met and talked in real life. We talked for so long, and you didn't want to go home. I remember thinking how nice the vibe was, just sitting there and talking with you.</div>
        <div class="card">After our first time meeting and our first date, I remember thinking to myself, this girl feels like the one. Everything felt so easy and right, like it all just made sense without trying.</div>
        <div class="card">And look at where we are now. It still feels unreal sometimes, but I wouldn't trade this for anything in the world</div>
        <div class="card">Despite any downs in the future, I want you to know my love for you isn't going anywhere, so you better buckle up!!!</div>
        <div class="card">No matter where life takes us next, I'm grateful it led me to you, and I can't wait to see where our story goes.</div>
